Write the best title lines for the functions that are called by the following main program. Do
not supply the blocks for the functions.

public class P1 {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
  int x = 2, y = 3, z[] = new int[4];
  boolean a = true, b = false, c[] = new boolean[4];
  String s = "Hello", t = "goodbye", u[][] = new String[4][5];
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) c[i] = data(x, y, 2.5); // (a)
  setToFive(z, c);
  System.out.println(z[1]); // (b) prints 5
  System.out.println(speedLimit(x, z[1])); // (c) prints 55
  System.out.println(numberStrings(4, u, 5)); // (d) prints 20
  f(numberStrings(0, u, 0), data(y, x, f(20, a || b))); // (e)
  }
}
(a)Title line for data as called at the line marked (a).
    public static Boolean data(int x, int y, double z){}
(b)Title line for setToFive as called at the line marked (b).
    public static void setToFive(int z[], Boolean c[]){}
(c)Title line for speedLimit as called at the line marked (c).
    public static int speedLimit(int x, int z) {}
(d) Title line for numberStrings as called at the line marked (d)
    public static String (int x, String s, int y) {}
(e) Title line for f as called at the line marked (e).
    public static int (String s, Boolean d) {}
